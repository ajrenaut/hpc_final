Final project for High-Performance Computing course. 

Performs matrix multiplication on large matrices by using both the cuBLAS library's SGEMM function, as well as a manual implementation of a matrix multiplication kernel.

NOTE: There is a mistake in the manual implementation that causes the results to be off by a non-negligible amount. Apparently high-performance computing is not my strongest field.
